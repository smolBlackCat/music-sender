====================
Music Sender Project
====================

What's this project about?
==========================

This project is a simple tool for those who likes to store music in their
drives instead of using a music streaming service. However, a known problem to
those people is the tiresome work of transferring all of their songs to each
device. When there's only two devices, an USB cable will do the job, but when
there's more, the work is kind of troublesome.

That's why Music Sender was created, to provide a efficient way of sending
musics to each of your devices simultaneously.

Dependencies
============

* Python >= 3.7
* colorama module


Installation
============

First of all, clone the project into your computer and change your working
directory to inside the project folder.::

    git clone https://github.com/smolBlackCat/music-sender.git
    cd music-sender

Now, execute this command::

    pip install .

And there is, you're ready to go. But to make sure, issue one of these commands
to make sure everything is fine.::

    <ms-server|ms-client> -h

If this shows a help guide, then everything is set up.
